//2. Create a HighSchool class that inherits from our base school class. Add a property that will represent a rival highschool. Additionally, add a property that will represent the school mascot.
//
// Add a function called pepRally that will print "\(school name) is the best! \(rival school name) is awful!"
//
// Override the schoolDescription function to make it print "\(school name) is the best in the state since \(the year it was built)! Go \(school mascot)'s!!!"
//
// Create an instance of a highschool and call both the schoolDescription and the pepRally functions.
